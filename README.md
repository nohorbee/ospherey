# Ospherey

Controlling [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/) with a REST API described with [RAML](http://raml.org) and implemented with [Osprey](https://github.com/mulesoft/osprey)

## Instructions

1. Clone (or fork and clone) this repository.
2. `npm install` in your project folder.
3. Pair your sphero with your computer
4. `grunt`
5. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000/api/console/
6. Have fun (it's mandatory)!

## Demo
I promise better videos for the next time, but see it working:
- [Ospherey - get color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDjXPEVWEbs)
- [Ospherey - set color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXIPgW_0k4w)
- [Ospherey - go go go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN182CzBlXI) - **Definitively my favorite one**

## Backlog
This was a quick and dirty development.
It is my intention to add more features to the API, and document it better (add descriptions to the resources, methods and parameters).

## Credits
Thanks to:
- https://github.com/usarid/spherest for the original idea and code.
- https://github.com/alchemycs/spheron for the great NodeJS Sphero library.
